This program creates a backup of your character data with each application. If you happen to lose your character or anything related to it, you can go to "C:\Users\\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\characters" and recover it.

Tested on Valheim 0.146.11 and Windows 10 x64 20H2. Not tested online.

Always use at your own risk. I am not responsible for the lost of any information from your character or any other harm to your copy of Valheim.

Related to the skin colors, please note that the default in-game skin tone is limited to a gray scale from 0% to ~70% black. Take this in mind when applying a new color so you can get the desired tone.
